# Tangerine Theme for VS Code
## Origin
This theme is basically a polished version of Tickle color theme from [Rainglow themes pack by Dayle Rees](https://github.com/rainglow/vscode).

Main coloring scheme has been tweaked just a tiny bit to address some Python/Django issues (including Django HTML Templates available with [Djaneiro](https://github.com/ScottBarkman/vscode-djaneiro) extension).
JSON scopes have been reworked significantly to reflect nesting levels. CSS scopes added for fancier and more distinguishable selectors. A lot of scopes definitions borrowed from the amazing [Pop! Theme dark](https://github.com/ArtisanByteCrafter/VSCodePopTheme).
